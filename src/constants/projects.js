        Three branches in the network: Encoder for feature extraction, Density Map Estimation (DME) for crowd density, and a reinforcement branch for faster convergence.
        Utilizes a combined loss function of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for density maps and Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) for reinforcement maps.
        Evaluated on multiple public datasets (UCF-QNRF, ShanghaiTech Part-A, UCF-CC-50) to ensure robustness in diverse crowd scenarios.
